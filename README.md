HElib Notes
===
This notes record the way how I have used the [HElib] in my research. I hope I can share some previous know-how that I have learned. [HElib] is a sophistic low-layer _FHE_ framework. I have met a lot of problems and have stuck in some weird situations; so I am pleasure to discuss with you.
